# jitter-analyzer
A simple jitter analyzer to handle raw data from the csv files.

  An example usage of the libraries is given at 'spect_jitter.cc'.
  
**Important**

  Currently it only handles a modified version of the csv files ( commas "," are required to be replaced with a blank space " " and the first line should be deleted).
  
  The library requires ROOT6 (mainly for the plotting functionality).
